# Dark Sky

In our final MDB project, we used the Dark Sky API to display information about the weather conditions and forecast. This application reports weather conditions for any location at any time that the user specifies into the options page. It also pinpoints the user's location and provides conditions based on his or her coordinates and time. I also implemented a feature to tell the user whether or not it was safe to go to school on that given day using some metrics found within the API.

## Main Weather Display
This view displays all of the most prominent information for the specified dates and times, including temperature in Fahrenheit, date, and given coordinates. It also has a handy icon to inform the user.
